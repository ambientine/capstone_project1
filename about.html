					<h1>COMPANY PROFILE</h1>
				</div>
					<p>Ourtees Printed Designs was established last December, 2013.  We first specialized in T-shirt printing but as we understand the need of our market, were able to identify  the opportunity in large format printing, to start with, we prefer to focus on Tarpaulin Printing.</p>  
					<p>Our company, <strong>OURTEES PRINTED DESIGNS</strong>  located in T56, 3rd floor besdie Unisilver, Novaliches Plaza Mall, Quirino Hiway, Novaliches, Quezon City. It was  founded by Danilo M. Flores and his partner, Shirlyn Daigo. With Danilo's experience in digital printing and Shirlyn's in marketing and corporate side, they are able to collaborate the mixes and able to make their first branch successful/established with the help of their regular clients. As a new step, they are now working on the second branch outside the mall but within Novaliches since the market is really big.</p>
					<p>Aside from Tarpaulin printing, <strong>OPD</strong> are  also offering  <strong>t-shirt printing</strong> (uniforms, batch/organization shirts), <strong>personalized items for souvenirs  / tokens  or corporate give-aways</strong> such as canvas bags, mouse pads, slate photo (photo rock),bag tags, tumblers, key chains, ref magnets, button pins, mugs, sports jags, pillows  & puzzles.
